# As of June 9th, 2017 all work towards projects has migrated over to [our new UW-Madison IEEE GitHub](https://github.com/uwmadisonieee)

# IEEE Mini Projects - UW-Madison
This is the home for the Mini Projects sessions UW-Madison IEEE Student Chapter host every fall. The goal for each year is to teach students valuable skills not taught directly in the classroom.

## About
We completely reworked our Mini Project system and have focused on using Raspberry Pi's and setting up all the boring system work to allow students to foucs purly on the work at hand. 

## Past Projects
- [Socket Pokemon](https://github.com/uwmadisonieee/Socket_Pokemon_2016) was revolved around teaching students how to create a TCP socket client and server that would interact with each other. We also covered how to work with a database, git, and the linux enviroment. To make it *fun* we also added a little gaming aspect to it as well.
- [Audio Savage](https://github.com/uwmadisonieee/Audio_Savage_2017) was designed to really make use of the GPIO pins of the Raspberry Pi by having students use various sensors to interact with audio via signal processing techniques.
  - This project is currently in development and will be ready for the Fall 2017 school year!
